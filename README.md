Collect the coins/gold stars/clouds to help classify the data set.

We track the user's path through the data as well as their score (a combination of the number of points they've hit plus a multiplier for keeping a good consistent run)

Using a combination of the path and the score across 50+ gamers of the same level, an accurate path through the data will be found.

N.B. when an enemy is presented to the player, we stop recording movement, as it's likely to be inaccurate due to the player trying to avoid the obstacle.
